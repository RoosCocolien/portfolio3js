				<h2>Art History</h2>
				<p>
					From a young age I have been surrounded by Art. My artistic mother always inspired me to follow my passion and try out new methods to create art. This creative environment drove me to deepen my theoretical knowledge and study Art History. The Middle Ages have always amazed me. Art was a pure craftmanship and deeply connected to religion. Exploring the paintings, drawings in manuscripts and scultures helped me uncovering the stories of those times. The church resembles this part of my life.

				<h2>Favorite Projects</h2>
				<h3>TekkieWorden</h3>
				<p>
					For TekkieWorden I have developed an assessment tool. This is a quiz in which the candidate discovers what kind of IT role suits them best. This project allowed me the opportunity to put all my newly gained skills to the test. Teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and diving into React, NodeJS, and MySQL drives me in my further advancement to become a creative developer.

				<h3>Codam Coding College</h3>
				<p>
					At Codam Coding College, together with 4 peers I have worked on a game angine based on the technisch used in Doom and Duke Nukem. Instead of only focusing on our coding skills, we got inspired by the creative skills of each other and used those to put something extra into our project: our own composed music, hand drawn textures (for the walls and the sprites), a creative storyline and a focus on inclusivity (the possibility to choose a different skin tone for the player).

				<h2>Other Hobbies</h2>
				<h3>Long distance cycling</h3>
				<p>
					Another great hobby of mine is long distance cycling. Taking everything with me, cooking stove, tent, sleeping mat etc, gives me the freedom to explore. The trips I have made so far thaught me to be fearless, explorative and assertive. And while I always feel a little bit anxious to go on another trip, it gives me great pleasure every time. That had thaught me to keep on learning new things, even when I feel a bit anxious.

					Do you see the bicycle on the right? In the future you might take that bike for a spin!

				<h2>Promoting Tech</h2>
				<p>
					Since I have entered the world of IT I have been amazed by the variety of the industry and community. Especially the women in tech communities. My passion for diversity and inclusivity, together with my eagerness to contribute to society, led to the collaboration with the platform “TekkieWorden”. I created vlogs and videos about my exploration of the IT world with the aim to inspire and motivate people to choose a career in IT.
